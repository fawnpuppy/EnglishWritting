The picture above shows a football game where an old man is being kicked like a football among his four children. Each of the young man is unwilling to take care of the old man as if they would not let him enter the gate behind them. This figure tries to raise people's awareness of attending to the elderly. 

For one thing, the elders care has become a serious social problem over the years. Thus it is the younger generation's responsibility to solve it, at least by taking care of their parents, to improve the overall welfare of our society. For another, it is our parents who give us life and teach us various skills to survive, to learn and to achieve our value. Therefore we shall, from moral perspective, provide them with both mental and material support and spend more time with them to make them feel that they are still being loved even if they are getting older.

To sum up, we, the younger generation, are responsible to provide both mental and physical help to our parents as it is what we shall do from social as well as moral perspective. 

### 基本思路

第一段描述图片和说明寓意各一句话，感觉不太够中间又加了一句过渡性质的（一半描述图，一半描述想法）。

第二段就是为什么赞成“照顾老人很重要”的观点。分了两点来写。

最后一段重复观点和原因。

### 遇到的问题

responsibility attendance welfare不会写

attendance 可能不是这么用的？应该用look after, attend to或者take care，直接care也可以

时间分配上，用了半个小时写完了初稿，算上誊写就超时了。下次打算压缩初稿的量尽量简洁一些看能否加速。

这篇文章最大的特点就是中间非常“厚实”，个人认为比较适合学习如何去批判一个观点。这里面想要批判的就是不去照顾父母的行为。从传统文化和道德两个角度出发。

+ 从传统文化的角度，写中国自古就有孝敬父母的传统（filial piety这个实在是太牛逼了要是我说估计就是a glorious tradition of loving and respecting elders），然后举了一个（根本没听过的）例子来论证。例子里面有处corporal punishment，不会其实也没啥关系，完全可以用who was sentenced to death或者capital punishment来代替。
+ 从道德角度，一句总说之外还带上两句反诘，从原因上进行论证。好吧其实挺普通的但是字数够了就ok

The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father's negligent children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father "roll into" their households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.

Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children's decent dressing, but their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse,  they discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer cares for others, one might even appear stupid or may even be distrusted.

Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of giving help and love to the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to over government to establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on face.

一开始还没有买到王江涛的时候抄的，感觉还凑合，但是06年作文百度文库上的范文就不太行了，所以还是买了书...

这篇出彩的地方就是第一段，描述特别细致，然而第二段以后就不太行了，第二段貌似是想将问题推广到更一般的层面，倒是不如分析问题来得容易。
